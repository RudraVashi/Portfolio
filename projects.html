            <h3> 1. Chemotaxis bacterial movement simulation for summer reasearch </h3>    
            <p> This was a project I did for my summer research program. 
                I used Python to handle the mathmetical equations behind the bacterial movement 
                while utilized Matlab to simulate the movement of bacteria in a chemical gradient. 
                Presented a poster presentation at a symposium at the end of the research.

            <h3> 2. Retro Space Shooter Game </h3>
            <p> This was a project I did for fun. I used Java to create a retro space shooter game to learn more about classes.</p>

            <h3> 3. This Website! </h3>
            <p> This was a project I did to learn more about web development. I used HTML and CSS to create this website. In the future I plan to mess around with javascript to make the website more dynamic. </p>
